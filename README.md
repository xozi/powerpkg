## powerpkg

This is solver for distrubution models currently using CUDA cuBLAS to preform matrix operations.
There is plenty of work to made in terms of optimization, I'm currently not utilizing kernals and merely the matrix operations, so solving is not optimized yet. Optimizations will be made later. 
In [[releases|https://github.com/xozi/powerpkg/releases/tag/homework]] you can find the binaries for sets of homework problems.
